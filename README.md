# Robotic-Arm

IEEE @ UCF

Just some theoretical code to work off of.
Currently, it's based on the idea of two push buttons and two analog sticks being put together as a joystick.

to use the libraries, create folders in documents->arduino->libraries that share the names of the h and cpp files
then paste the h and cpp files into their respective folders
